In-station members can send their documents to: contentions@iaeste.in Outstation members can send their documents to: applications@iaeste.in</p>
				<p>Winning an offer All the applications received during Contentions are reviewed by a Panel of Experts, and they choose an applicant who is most suitable for a particular internship. If you apply for multiple offers, you can win at most one. If you win an offer, you will be notified via text as well as email.</p>
