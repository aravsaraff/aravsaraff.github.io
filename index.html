                "I was amazed by the number of interns here and how friendly the environment was between the interns and the local committee. I think LC Manipal does a great job with all the parties and introducing us to India's culture. Here I learned way more than I expected, I thought I was coming to gain and improve technical skills related to electrical engineering, and what I received was so much more, it was a life lesson that I will always remember. Thank you for everything and continue to do as well if not better."<br><br>
